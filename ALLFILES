	tiles greater than 128, because there are 16 of each, depending
	on whether there are connections up, down, left and right.
new/tempp.a
	I'm not sure what this is. I think it's an old version of
	ledit. Can be ignored.

	All the artwork for the animations. There is no animation
	code written so far. I had planned to write a simple script
	processor, that would let you place pieces of art onto the
	A and B planes, then let you scroll them around.
new/sammyart/pic4

new/sammyart/gfx
	parameter file and data file for all the breach graphics
	Also all the graphics files. Some are not used. Look at
	gfx.par. Only listed files are used.
new/sammyart/mr.a
new/sammyart/mr

new/sammyart/comp/mrt.a

new/sammyart/comp/fix.a
new/sammyart/comp/fix
new/sammyart/comp/NOTES
	test files for seeing what compression methods would help
	reduce size. Take in data file produced with mrt. Mrt works
	exactly like mr, except it produces only tile data. The
	tile data allows experiments on compression methods.

	Some more artwork. This may be redundant with the /anims
	directory
new/samples
	Ascii text file showing possible better format for mission
	selection screen
new/sounddata
	All the sound effects used in the program. Is of the form:
	word   # of sounds following
	;each sound is of this form:
	word samplerate	;this is ignored
	long samplesize	;# of bytes of this sample
	byte samples[samplesize]
new/sd2
	Sounddata, made by throwing every other byte away. This
	lowers sound quality some, but cuts size by 1/2.
new/fix.a
new/fix
	Takes amiga breach levels and uncompresses them. This is
	the basis for several other programs.

new/levels/landing
	All the Amiga levels that have been converted so far. Use
	LC, then LEDIT.
new/levels/shrink.a
new/levels/shrink
	program to shrink levels, for a sort of compression. Adds a
	planepick byte which tells which 50x50 levels to define, and
	also an objectnum, so only as many objects need to be placed
	as are required. This alone does some pretty good compression.
	See the README file.
