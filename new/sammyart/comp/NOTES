Histogram:
When there are less than 7 unique bytes in the 32 byte definition, the
following compression can be used:
1 byte value
4 byte mask where used
Thus 5xn bytes is used.
Roughly 675/2085 tiles can benefit from this, reducing size of those tiles
by 14190/21600.

Repeats:
When there are a lot of repeat nibbles, the following compression can be used:
1 nibble count
1 nibble value
Thus 1 byte can represent up to 8 bytes.
Useful only if there are less than 32 separate transitions.
Roughly 1409/2085 tiles can benefit from this, reducing the size of those tiles
by 26981/45088
